# Object Detection 

Deep neural networks for object detection yield by far the quickest and most accurate results for single and multiple object detection since CNNs are capable of automated learning with less manual engineering involved.

## Using yolov8

>Technically speaking, YOLOv8 is a group of convolutional neural network models, created and trained using the PyTorch framework. In addition, the YOLOv8 package provides a single Python API to work with all of them using the same methods. That is why, to use it, you need an environment to run Python code

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
